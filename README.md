This repository is a collaboration between @mwunnam and @HayfordHumade.

We are building a custom C printf function as part of our ALX Sofware Engineering program.
The printf function is a variadic function whose prototype is of the form:

	int printf(const char *format, ...);

This README file lists all the files in the repo and also describes its prototypes.

Filename:	0-printf.c
Prototype:	int _printf(const char *format, ...);
