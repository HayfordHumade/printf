<h1>About the custom Printf Project</h1>

This project is a collaboration between @mwunnam and @HayfordHumade.

We are building a custom C printf function as part of our ALX Sofware Engineering training program.
The printf function is a variadic function whose prototype is of the form:

	int printf(const char *format, ...);

This README file lists all the files in this directory and also describes its prototypes.
